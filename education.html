<p class="education">I'm a second-year student at Northeastern University in the moderately bike-friendly city of Boston, MA. </p>

<p class="education">Cross your fingers for me: I am a candidate for degree for a proposed combined degree in Computer Science and Marine Science from the College of Computer and Information Science.</p>

<p class="education">I was lucky enough to have attended a United World College, in New Mexico, with 200 students from 80 countries for my last two years of high school, graduating with an International Baccalaureate diploma. This is where all of my ideas and views about the world gained sunlight and nutrients, n our missino for peace and sustainability.</p>
